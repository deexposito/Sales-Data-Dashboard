# Sales Insights: Descriptive Analytics on E-Commerce Data

## Project Overview
This project dives into descriptive analytics of sales data from an online UK-based retail store specializing in unique, all-occasion gifts. Using a dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning repository, I explored over a year of transactions, identifying trends and patterns that provide key insights into the companyâ€™s sales performance.

## Analysis
This project performs several key steps:
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressing missing values and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing sales performance, product demand, and customer behavior.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Highlighting trends in transactions, customer orders, and geographical insights.
- **Visualization:** Using Seaborn and Matplotlib to create meaningful visualizations of sales patterns.

## Results
- Identified top-selling products and key geographical markets.
- Analyzed customer purchasing behavior and discovered seasonal sales trends.
- Provided insights into the sales performance of the company over a year.
